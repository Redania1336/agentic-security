# Agentic Security Scanner: How to Build Complex AI SaaS Applications Using Roo Code

Building an AI-powered SaaS application requires more than just choosing the right models—it demands **a structured development process** that ensures scalability, maintainability, and test-driven reliability. The **Agentic Security Scanner** is a perfect example of this approach in action, using **Roo Code Power Steering** to streamline the development of an AI-driven security tool that **analyzes code for vulnerabilities, dependencies, and configuration risks.**

## Structured Multi-Phase Development Approach

Instead of diving into a monolithic codebase, we structured development into **clear, incremental phases**, ensuring each feature was fully functional before moving to the next. This **multi-phase strategy** helps manage complexity and prevents scope creep, making AI-driven development **predictable and scalable**.

### Development Process Overview

The process began with careful planning and documentation:

1. **Initial Project Planning**: Defining the core functionality and value proposition
2. **Architecture Design**: Establishing an organized folder structure and component approach
3. **Incremental Development**: Breaking down the project into manageable, testable phases
4. **Continuous Testing**: Validating each feature before moving to the next
5. **Documentation & Progress Tracking**: Maintaining detailed records of completed work

Each feature was approached methodically:
- Define the feature in a planning document
- Create a test specification
- Implement the feature in small, incremental steps
- Verify through automated and manual testing
- Document completion and move to the next priority

### Core Development Phases

  - Outlines testing approach for each component and feature
  - Defines validation criteria for edge function integration
  - Establishes end-to-end test workflows to verify user journeys
  - Creates mocking strategies for external dependencies
  
- **[Implementation.md](./plans/Implementation.md)** – Tracks **progress, updates, and completed features** for continuous iteration.
  - Serves as a living document updated throughout development
  - Provides transparency into completion status
  - Captures implementation decisions and architecture evolution
  - Maintains accountability for feature delivery

Each phase was **test-driven**, meaning features weren't just built—they were validated before progressing. This **ensures quality, avoids regression, and creates a self-documenting development process.**

## Leveraging Roo Code Power Steering

Using **Roo Code's Power Steering**, AI-generated code was **kept strictly in line** with the predefined architecture and development rules. This provided several key benefits:

- **Consistent Coding Standards** – Ensured uniformity across all AI-generated components through adherence to the guidance document
- **Incremental Development** – Each phase was completed **independently** and tested before moving forward
- **Automated Documentation** – Implementation progress was tracked in real time, avoiding manual overhead
- **Environment Variable Protection** – No hardcoded credentials or sensitive values
- **Modular Component Architecture** – Creating reusable UI components and hooks
- **Progressive Enhancement** – Adding advanced features on top of a solid core foundation
- **Test Coverage Maintenance** – Ensuring new features didn't break existing functionality
- **Performance Optimization** – Ensuring responsive design and efficient code patterns

## Development Workflow Innovation

The project introduced several innovative development practices:

### 1. Feature-Oriented Planning
Rather than planning by technical layers (backend, frontend, database), we planned by feature sets that delivered complete user value. Each feature was designed, implemented, and tested as a cohesive unit.

### 2. Living Documentation
All plan documents were treated as living artifacts that evolved as development progressed. The Implementation.md file served as a continuous changelog of completed work.

### 3. Atomic Development Units
Features were broken down into atomic units that could be completed in a single development session, leading to predictable progress and easier integration.

### 4. Front-Loaded Quality Assurance
Testing requirements were defined before implementation began, ensuring developers had clear success criteria before writing code.
