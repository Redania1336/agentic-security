# Phase 3: GitHub Integration and Automation

## Objectives
- Implement GitHub issue creation for vulnerabilities
- Add automated scanning via GitHub Actions
- Create a dashboard for monitoring security posture
- Implement user preferences and customization

## Tasks

### 1. GitHub Integration
- [ ] Add authentication for GitHub API access
- [ ] Implement issue creation for security findings
- [ ] Create templates for different vulnerability types
- [ ] Add linking between findings and created issues

### 2. Automated Scanning
- [ ] Create UI for scheduling automatic scans
- [ ] Implement cron job configuration
- [ ] Add notifications for scheduled scan results
- [ ] Create scan history comparison visualizations

### 3. Security Dashboard
- [ ] Design and implement a security posture dashboard
- [ ] Add trend analysis for vulnerabilities over time
- [ ] Create visualizations for findings by severity and type
- [ ] Implement repository comparison features

### 4. User Preferences
- [ ] Create user settings for default scan options
- [ ] Implement theme customization (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Add notification preferences
- [ ] Create custom templates for reports and issues

## Testing Criteria
- GitHub issues should be created with correct information
