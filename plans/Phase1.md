# Phase 1: Core Security Scanner Setup

## Objectives
- Establish the basic structure of the security scanner application
- Implement core data models and state management
- Create the primary UI components for user interaction
- Set up local storage for scan history

## Tasks

### 1. Setup Base Data Models
- [ ] Define interfaces for scan results, findings, and summary
- [ ] Create types for severity levels and scan statuses
- [ ] Implement mock data generation for testing

### 2. Implement State Management
- [ ] Create a custom hook for managing scan state
- [ ] Set up local storage integration for persistence
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD operations for scan results

### 3. Build Core UI Components
- [ ] Create the scanner form component
- [ ] Implement the scan results display
- [ ] Build the scan history view
- [ ] Design the repository input with validation

### 4. Setup API Integration
- [ ] Create a service layer for edge function communication
- [ ] Implement error handling for API requests
- [ ] Add loading states for better user experience

## Testing Criteria
- The scanner form should validate repository inputs
- Scan results should be properly displayed with severity indicators
- Scan history should persist across page refreshes
- Mock API should correctly simulate the scanning process
- UI should be responsive across different device sizes

## Deliverables
- Working scanner form with repository input
- Results display component showing mock findings
- Functional scan history with persistence
- Unit tests covering core functionality

## Notes
- Focus on establishing a solid foundation without overengineering
- Ensure all environment variables are properly configured
- Document all APIs and interfaces as they are developed
- Create small, focused components that can be reused in later phases
