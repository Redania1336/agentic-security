# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of the Security Scanner implementation across different phases. It is updated after each successful step is completed.

## Phase 1: Core Security Scanner Setup

### Completed Items
- âœ… Created basic data models and interfaces in `src/types/scanner.ts`
- âœ… Implemented local storage-based state management with `useScanStore` hook
- âœ… Built scanner form component with repository input validation
- âœ… Created scan results display component with severity indicators
- âœ… Added scan history component with persistence
- âœ… Implemented mock data generation for testing
- âœ… Created responsive UI layouts for both mobile and desktop

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Improving form validation and error handling
- ðŸ”„ Enhancing accessibility of the scanner form

### Notes
- Local storage implementation successfully persists scan history between sessions
- Mock data provides realistic test scenarios for development
- Basic UI components are responsive and follow design guidelines

## Phase 2: Advanced Features (Not Started)

This phase will begin after all Phase 1 items are completed and tested.

## Phase 3: GitHub Integration (Not Started)

This phase will begin after all Phase 2 items are completed and tested.

## Known Issues & Limitations
- Need to implement better error handling for edge cases
- Currently using mock data instead of real API calls
- Advanced scanning options UI needs refinement

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining Phase 1 tasks
2. Write comprehensive tests for core functionality
3. Begin planning for Phase 2 implementation
4. Review and refine documentation
