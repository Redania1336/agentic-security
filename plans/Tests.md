# Test Specifications

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Security Scanner application, ensuring each component and feature is thoroughly validated.

## Unit Tests

### Data Models and Utilities
- Test data type validations
- Verify mock data generators produce correct structures
- Ensure utility functions handle edge cases properly

### State Management
- Test state initialization with and without existing data
- Verify CRUD operations on scan results
- Ensure proper persistence to local storage
- Test loading states and error handling

### UI Components
- Verify form validation for repository input
- Test conditional rendering based on scan states
- Ensure proper display of scan results by severity
- Verify that filters and sorting work correctly

### API Integration
- Mock and test API requests and responses
- Verify error handling and retries
- Test token authentication and session management
- Ensure proper handling of rate limits

## Integration Tests

### Form to Results Flow
- Complete form submission should trigger correct API calls
- Results should be properly stored and displayed
- History should be updated with new scan results

### History to Details Navigation
- Selecting history items should display correct details
- Filtering and sorting should work across the application
- Pagination should maintain state during navigation

### GitHub Integration Flow
- Issue creation should generate proper GitHub API calls
- Created issues should link back to scan findings
- Authentication flow should work seamlessly

### Automated Scanning
- Scheduled scans should be properly configured
- Notifications should be triggered when scans complete
- Results should be accessible from history

## End-to-End Tests

### Complete Scan Workflow
- User can input repository and options
- Scan executes and displays results
- Results can be explored and filtered
- Reports can be generated and shared

### GitHub Actions Integration
- User can configure automated scanning
- GitHub Actions workflows are created
- Results are processed and stored correctly

### Dashboard Functionality
- Security posture is accurately displayed
- Trends are visualized correctly
- Filtering and date range selections work properly

## Performance Tests

### Large Result Sets
- Application handles repositories with many findings
- Pagination and virtualization work effectively
- Sorting and filtering remain performant

### Concurrent Operations
- Multiple scans can be viewed without performance issues
- Background operations don't block the UI
- Local storage operations don't impact performance

## Accessibility Tests

### Keyboard Navigation
- All features are accessible via keyboard
- Focus states are clearly visible
- Tab order is logical and intuitive

### Screen Reader Compatibility
- ARIA attributes are used correctly
- All information is available to screen readers
- Dynamic content updates are properly announced

## Mobile Responsiveness Tests

### Small Screen Layouts
- Forms are usable on mobile devices
- Tables and visualizations adapt to small screens
- Touch targets are appropriately sized

### Tablet and Medium Screens
- Layouts adjust appropriately for medium screens
- Split views utilize space effectively
- Font sizes and spacing remain comfortable

## Test Implementation Guidelines

1. Use Jest for unit and integration tests
2. Implement MSW for API mocking
3. Use React Testing Library for component tests
4. Create test fixtures for common data scenarios
5. Implement test databases for integration testing
6. Use Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end testing
7. Automate accessibility testing with axe-core
8. Implement visual regression testing for UI components

Remember to run tests before each phase completion, and don't proceed to the next phase until all tests pass.
