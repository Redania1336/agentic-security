# Development Guidance

## Coding Standards and Best Practices

### General Principles
- Follow SOLID principles for object-oriented design
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names that clearly describe their purpose
- Write code that is self-documenting whenever possible
- Add comments only for complex algorithms or business rules

### Project Structure
- Organize code by feature rather than by type
- Use consistent file naming across the project
- Create small, focused components rather than large monolithic ones
- Separate business logic from UI components

### TypeScript Standards
- Use strict type checking
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
- Use generics to create reusable components
- Leverage discriminated unions for state management

### React Best Practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep component state minimal and focused
- Leverage React's Context API for state that needs to be shared between components
- Use custom hooks to abstract complex logic
- Follow the presentational and container component pattern

### Styling Conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling components
- Follow responsive design principles
- Maintain a consistent color scheme using the design tokens
- Use CSS variables for themes and dynamic styling

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all business logic
- Create integration tests for component interactions
- Use snapshot testing sparingly and with purpose
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Aim for high test coverage but prioritize critical paths

### Security Considerations
- Never hardcode sensitive information, use environment variables
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid security vulnerabilities

### Performance Guidelines
- Optimize renders with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback
- Implement virtualization for long lists
- Use code splitting for large applications
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper loading states and lazy loading

### Accessibility Standards
- Ensure proper semantic HTML
- Support keyboard navigation
- Use appropriate ARIA attributes
- Maintain sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers

Remember: Consistency is key. Follow these guidelines throughout the project to maintain a high-quality, maintainable codebase.
