## Development Approach

The project uses a multi-phase development approach with Roo Code Power Steering:

- **Incremental Development**: Breaking the project into manageable phases with clear deliverables
- **Test-Driven Development**: Creating test specifications before implementation
- **Progress Tracking**: Continuous updates to Implementation.md as features are completed
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus on responsive design and efficient code

For more details on the overall project, refer to the [main README](../../README.md) in the project root.
