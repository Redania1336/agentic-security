# Phase 2: Advanced Features and Edge Function Integration

## Objectives
- Integrate with actual edge functions for security scanning
- Implement advanced filtering and sorting options
- Add detailed security findings view
- Create reporting capabilities

## Tasks

### 1. Edge Function Integration
- [ ] Connect to the actual security scanner edge function
- [ ] Implement proper authentication for API requests
- [ ] Handle real scan responses and errors
- [ ] Create retry mechanisms for failed requests

### 2. Advanced Scanning Options
- [ ] Implement branch selection for repositories
- [ ] Add support for custom scan depth and file types
- [ ] Enable web search option for enhanced vulnerability detection
- [ ] Implement historical analysis comparison

### 3. Detailed Findings View
- [ ] Create expandable findings cards with detailed information
- [ ] Add code snippets display for vulnerable sections
- [ ] Implement severity filtering and sorting
- [ ] Add recommendations for fixing issues

### 4. Reporting Capabilities
- [ ] Generate shareable reports from scan results
- [ ] Add email integration for sending reports
- [ ] Implement export options (PDF, CSV)
- [ ] Create dashboard for scan statistics

## Testing Criteria
- The edge function should be properly called with correct parameters
- Advanced options should modify the scan behavior appropriately
- Detailed findings should display all relevant information
- Reports should be generated in the correct format
- All features should work across different browsers and devices

## Deliverables
- Functional integration with edge functions
- Advanced scanning options UI
- Detailed findings view with filtering
- Report generation functionality
- Comprehensive test suite

## Notes
- Focus on error handling and user feedback
- Ensure proper loading states during API calls
- Implement progressive enhancement for features
- Maintain performance even with large scan results
- Document all edge function parameters and responses
